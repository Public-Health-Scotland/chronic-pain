# Chronic Pain Publication

The [Chronic Pain Waiting Times publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/chronic-pain-waiting-times) is a quarterly publication from Public Health Scotland (PHS) that is currently undergoing development to become a RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline). All the necessary code will therefore be included in this repository.


## Project Structure

The publication process is organised as below. *While under development, this structure may have to change.*

```
├── data*                    // outputs created by the project - * not tracked by Git
├── docs                     // documentation for the project
├── code                     // code for generating the publication
├── functions                // created functions used within the code
├── markdown                 // templates for generating the publication document
└── tests                    // code for testing the functions used within the project
```
